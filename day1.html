<!DOCTYPE html> <!--this is used to declare that this file is an html file-->
<html><!--this is an opening html tag-->
    <head> <!--the head tag cantains the information of our web page-->
             <title> this is my first web page</title> <!--this is the title to the web page-->
             
    </head>
    <body>
     <h1> this is an h1 heading</h1><!--this is a tag -->
    <h4> this is an h4 heading </h4>
    <h6> this is an h6 heading  </h6>
    <hr><!--this is usded to add a horizontal line to the page-->
    <br> <!---br means line break it is used to provide space b/w any two line of a pragrapgh--->
    <p> this is my first html paragraph</p>
    <pre><!--this tag retains  any line break or spaces in the pragraph-->
            if we use pre tag for writing a pragrapgh in html 

            then you can see that i was able to give line break(space)
            without using br tag
            
            

            see this time i gave 3 line break 
        </pre>
    </body>
